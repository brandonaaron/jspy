# jspy

A while back I started learning Python. To help me learn and retain I started implementing some Python methods in JavaScript. I got distracted from learning Python and haven't found the time to continue. Currently I've only implemented a few string methods. I just recently wrote the specs using Screw Unit for the methods I've implemented. Just wanted to get this into source control so I don't loose it.
